#Getting and Cleaning Data
--------------- 
 
This is a repository for code written for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course through Johns Hopkins University.

### Course Project
All data used in the course project can be found in the UCI HAR Dataset folder or downloaded from the source at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The R script run_analysis.R creates a tidy data set from the data found in the UCI HAR Dataset which is saved in the text file average_tidy_data.R.

The CodeBook.md file shows the changes made to the original data to arrive at the tidy data set.
